# Questions: Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering refers to the principles, methods and techniques used to crete quality software.


# What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 

While software engineering deals with pricinples and techniques used to create quality software, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) systematically outlines the steps that are followed to create software from start to finish.


# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
# Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

SDLC involves a series of steps, they include:
1. Planning: This is the initial phase where business requirements are gathered and where the project scope and goals are gathered.

2. Analyzing: The requirements gathered are analyzed. The functional and non-functional requirements are determined.

3. Design: This phase involves creating a high level architecture of the software.

4. Implementation: The design of the software is translated into source code.

5. Testing: During this phase, the developed software is tested to find errors and ensure that the software meets the requirements.

6. Deployment: Once the testing phase is done, the software is released to be used by the end-users.

7. Maintenance: After the software is deployed, maintenance is needed to be carried out to enable the software to update changes in the environment.

WATERFALL Vs AGILE MODELS

WATERFALL MODEL
This SDLC model follows a linear and sequential approach where one phase must be completed before the next phase begins. The model is easy to understand and manage. 
One demerit is that this model is best suited for short term projects.

AGILE MODEL
This SDLC model is an iterative and incremental approch to software development whereby it relies on feedback for continous evaluation and improvement.

# Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 

Modularity refers to breaking down of a software system into smaller, independent units known as modules.
Each module has its own functionalities and they are able to interact with other modules.

MERITS
++++++++++++

Improved Maintainability:
    . Modules are isolated hence changes can be made without affecting others.
    . Errors are easily indentified within the individual modules.

Improved Scalability
    . It is possible to create and introduce new modules without affecting the existing ones.
    . Modules can be reused in different projects.


# Testing in Software Engineering:
# Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 

Software Testing ensures that the product meets its requirements, and delivers a high level of quality. 

The are several levels of software testing, they include;

1. Unit Testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation. Unit testing helps identify bugs early in the development process and facilitates easier debugging and maintenance.

2. Integration Testing: Integration testing evaluates the interactions between different modules of code when integrated together. It verifies that these components work together as intended and that data flows correctly between them.

3. System Testing: System testing evaluates the entire software system as a whole. It verifies that the integrated system meets specified requirements and functions correctly in its intended environment.

4. Acceptance Testing: Involves validating the software against business requirements and user expectations. It ensures that the software meets the needs of its stakeholders and is ready for deployment. 

Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons:

1. Bug Detection.
2. Compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.
3. Risk Mitigation.


# Version Control Systems:
# What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that track changes to files and manage different versions of software projects.

 They are important in software development because they enable collaboration among team members, and provide a mechanism for tracking and reverting changes.

 One of the most popular VCS is: 

 Git:
    > Distributed version control system.
    > Lightweight and fast.
    > Allows for branching and merging, enabling parallel development workflows.


# Software Project Management:
# Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 

A software Manager oversees the project from start to finish.
They work as the link between everyone involved, making sure things run smoothly.

Some key reponsibilities of project managers include: 

    1. Project Planning: Project managers are responsible for defining the project goals, timelines and resource requirements.

    2. Stakeholder Communication: Project Managers communicate with stakeholders to understand their expectations and requirements.

    3. Risk Management: Project managers identify potential risks and uncertainties that may impact the timely project delivery.

Challanges that can be faced include:
    1. Scope Creep: When the project keeps growing beyond what was planned, causing delays and headaches.

    2. Limited Resources : When there's not enough time, money, or skilled folks to get the job done.

    3. Technical Troubles: Dealing with tricky technical stuff that can slow things down if not handled properly.

    4. Communication Struggles: When people aren't talking or listening, causing misunderstandings and delays.


# Software Maintenance:
# Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance involves making changes and updates to software after it has been deployed to ensure its continued effectiveness, stability, and relevance.

There are several types of maintenance activities:

    Corrective Maintenance: Involves fixing bugs, errors, or issues discovered after the software is deployed, ensuring that it operates correctly and meets user expectations.

    Adaptive Maintenance: Involves modifying the software to adapt to changes in the environment, such as operating system updates, hardware upgrades, or regulatory requirements.

    Perfective Maintenance: Involves enhancing the software to improve performance, usability, or functionality based on user feedback or evolving business needs.

Maintenance is an essential part of the software lifecycle because:

    It ensures that software remains functional, reliable, and secure over time, meeting the needs of users and stakeholders.

    It allows software to evolve and adapt to changing requirements, technologies, and business environments.

    It helps extend the lifespan of software investments, maximizing their value and return on investment.


# Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
# What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues for software engineers include:

    1. Privacy: Protecting user data and respecting privacy rights.

    2. Bias: Avoiding biased algorithms or systems that discriminate against certain groups.

    3. Security: Building secure software to prevent data breaches and cyberattacks.

    4. Transparency: Being transparent about how software works and its potential impacts.

    5. Accountability: Taking responsibility for the consequences of software development decisions.
